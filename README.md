# wiring-cost of ANNs 

This repository provides basic implementations of wiring cost controlled training framework in Tensorflow. The scripts in this repository demonstrate how to analyze the effects of geometric and wiring cost constraints on the performance, topology, and wiring efficiency of sparse Gate Recurrent Units (GRUs). More advanced simulations and mathematical analyses can be found in our paper titled "Brain-inspired wiring economics for artificial neural networks" by X.-J. Zhang, et al.
